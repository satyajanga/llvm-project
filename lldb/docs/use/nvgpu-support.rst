NVIDIA GPU Support in LLDB
==========================

System requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to have the CUDA Driver and the CUDA Toolkit installed. They can be
installed following the `official download page <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=24.04&target_type=deb_network>`_.

The minimal version of the CUDA Toolkit and CUDA driver that is supported is
13.0.0.

CMake requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The only requirement for building the plugin is that you need to specify the
CMake variable `LLDB_ENABLE_NVGPU_PLUGIN` as `ON`. Everything else
related to the build system should be taken care of automatically, except
for uncommon CUDA Toolkit and CUDA driver installations, which will require
you to provide some CMake variables manually. See the CMake variables section
below.

CMake variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `LLDB_ENABLE_NVGPU_PLUGIN`: enables this plugin at the build system level.
- `NVGPU_DEBUGGER_INCLUDE_DIR`: path to the CUDA debugger headers required
  to build this plugin. This is the folder that contains the
  `cudadebugger.h` and `cudacoredump.h` header files, e.g.
  `/usr/local/cuda/extras/Debugger/include`. If the CUDA Toolkit is
  installed in a standard location, this variable will be deduced
  automatically.
- `NVGPU_NVCC_PATH`: path to the NVCC compiler to use in tests. If the CUDA
  Toolkit is installed in a standard location, this variable will be deduced
  automatically.
- `NVGPU_CUDBG_INJECTION_PATH`: path to the CUDA debugger injection library.
  Can also be set at runtime. See Environment variables section for more
  details.
- `NVGPU_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: controls which CUDA devices are visible to the
  application being debugged. Can also be set at runtime. See Environment
  variables section for more details.
- `NVGPU_CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER`: controls the ordering of CUDA devices. Can also
  be set at runtime. See Environment variables section for more details.
- `NVGPU_CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING`: when set to "1", forces CUDA kernel launches
  to be synchronous. Can also be set at runtime. See Environment variables
  section for more details.
- `NVGPU_INITIALIZATION_SYMBOL`: an optional CPU symbol to use to identify
  that the CUDA runtime is being initialized.
- `NVGPU_DISASSEMBLER_PATH`: a default path to the nvdisasm disassembler that
  will be hardcoded in LLDB. It bypasses the regular disassembler discovery
  logic.
- `NVGPU_TEST_LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: a way to override LD_LIBRARY_PATH for NVGPU
  tests. This doesn't affect regular builds.

Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following environment variables can be set to control CUDA debugging
behavior when lldb-server starts:

- `CUDBG_INJECTION_PATH`: path to the CUDA debugger injection library. This
  specifies which debugger library should be injected into CUDA applications
  for debugging support. When set, this will be automatically applied when
  the NVIDIA GPU plugin initializes.

- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: controls which CUDA devices are visible to the
  application being debugged. This can be used to restrict debugging to
  specific GPUs. For example, setting this to "0" will make only GPU 0
  visible to the debugged application.

- `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER`: controls the ordering of CUDA devices. Common values
  are "FASTEST_FIRST" to prioritize faster devices, or "PCI_BUS_ID" to use
  PCI bus ordering. This affects which device gets which device ID.

- `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING`: when set to "1", forces CUDA kernel launches to be
  synchronous, which can be helpful for debugging by making kernel execution
  more predictable and easier to trace.

- `NVGPU_DISABLE_CPU_STOP_ON_GPU_STOP`: when set to "1", disables the automatic
  suspension of the CPU process when the GPU is stopped.

These environment variables can be set in the shell environment before
starting lldb-server.

Driver compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This plugin relies on a header file provided by NVIDIA `cudadebugger.h` that
contains hardcoded version numbers of the CUDA driver this plugin will interact
with. This header is provided by the current CUDA Toolkit installation, unless
specified manually via the `NVGPU_DEBUGGER_INCLUDE_DIR` CMake variable.
Make sure that this version matches the one of your driver, otherwise this
plugin won't be able to initialize.

- The version numbers in this header file are specified by the variables
  `CUDBG_API_VERSION_MAJOR` and `CUDBG_API_VERSION_MINOR`.
- The version of your driver can be obtained via the `DRIVER version` section
  of the `nvidia-smi --version` output.

Running the tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

  # First build the test runner
  ninja lldb-dotest
  # Now you can run the tests
  ./bin/llvm-lit ../llvm-project/lldb/test/API/gpu/nvidia/ -a -v


Remote platforms - Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can connect to a remote platform and connect the the GPU lldb-server by
setting up the following environment variables:

- `NVGPU_DEBUGGER_REMOTE_LISTEN_TO_HOST`: the host to listen to for remote
  connections.
- `NVGPU_DEBUGGER_REMOTE_LISTEN_TO_PORT`: the port to listen to for remote
  connections.
- `NVGPU_DEBUGGER_REMOTE_HOST`: the host to connect to for remote
  connections.

Example:

First launch the lldb-server in platform mode on the machine with IP address
`10.112.215.212` with these variables set:

.. code-block:: bash

  NVGPU_DEBUGGER_REMOTE_LISTEN_TO_PORT=0 \
  NVGPU_DEBUGGER_REMOTE_LISTEN_TO_HOST="*" \
  NVGPU_DEBUGGER_REMOTE_HOST="10.112.215.212" \
  ./bin/lldb-server platform --listen  "*:12346" --server

Then connect remotely to the lldb-server with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  lldb
  > platform select remote-linux
  > platform connect connect://10.112.215.212:12346
  > file /remote/path/to/a/program
  > run

Remote platforms - Android
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Android support is much simpler than the regular Linux remote support as you
don't need to set any environment variables.

Example:

First launch the lldb-server in platform mode on the Android device with the
correct port forwarding set up:

.. code-block:: bash

  # On the host
  adb forward tcp:5039 tcp:5039
  # On the Android device
  ./lldb-server platform --listen '*:5039' --server

Then connect remotely to the lldb-server with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  lldb
  > platform select remote-android
  > platform connect connect://:5039
  > file /remote/path/to/a/program
  > run
